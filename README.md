# Mac

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.2.

## Summary

This is a demo of using [a mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) in Angular, and in particular capturing node click events. The page for this demo website has more description, and the code obviously has the best details.

NOTE! There are two defects in the versions of two packages, mermaid & @types/mermaid. Follow the directions on the demo web page to work around these defects. The defects are not with communicating between mermaid and Angular, but you need to work around them to get this demo to work.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
